# Iris Classifier 

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

We use two models:
- Decision Tree Classifier (with hyperparameter tuning)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation includes accuracy, confusion matrix and feature importance. The notebook was developed in Google Colab using the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
