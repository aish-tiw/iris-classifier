# Iris Classifier (Decision Tree & KNN)

## Overview
This project implements a simple machine learning pipeline on the classic Iris dataset.  
It trains and evaluates a **Decision Tree Classifier** (with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning) and a **K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier**.  
The script saves both the **confusion matrix (PNG)** and the **trained model (.joblib)** into the `outputs/` folder.

This repository is structured for reproducibility and assessment purposes.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:
```bash
